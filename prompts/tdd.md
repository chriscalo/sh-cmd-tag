# Design to Tasks Prompt

## Purpose

A systematic approach to decompose design specifications into tasks using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow. Each task represents one behavior and maps to one test, ensuring comprehensive coverage and maintainable implementation.

## Usage

### Planning Mode
Use when you need to break down a design document into tasks:

```
Plan TDD tasks for `[design-file]`.

- Decompose the design into discrete tasks
- One behavior : one test
- List all tasks upfront with test names
- Walk through each task for user approval
```

### Execution Mode
Use when you need to implement tasks using strict TDD workflow:

```
Execute TDD task `[task-name]` from `[design-file]`.

- Follow strict TDD: ðŸŸ¢ Green â†’ ðŸ”´ Red â†’ ðŸŸ¢ Green â†’ ðŸŸ¢ Refactor
- Work through Green-Red-Green automatically
- Refactor interactively with user
```

## Workflow Modes

### Planning Mode
Decompose the design into tasks interactively:
- Parse the design document for key requirements
- Identify functional components and behaviors
- List all tasks upfront with test names
- Walk through each task for user approval
- User says "approved" to proceed with TDD cycle

### Execution Mode  
Implement tasks using strict TDD workflow:

#### Step 1: ðŸŸ¢ Green (Establish Baseline)
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Verify current system state
- Document any assumptions or dependencies

#### Step 2: ðŸ”´ Red (Write Failing Test)
- Write one test that defines the desired behavior
- Test should fail for the right reason
- Verify test fails as expected

#### Step 3: ðŸŸ¢ Green (Make It Pass)
- Write minimal implementation to make tests pass
- Focus on functionality, not perfection
- Ensure all tests pass (new and existing)

#### Step 4: ðŸŸ¢ Green (Interactive Refactor)
- Collaboratively improve code quality with user
- Maintain test coverage throughout
- Keep all tests passing during refactoring

## Process Flow

### 1. Design Analysis
- Parse the design document for key requirements
- Identify functional components and behaviors
- Map out dependencies between features
- Highlight integration points and edge cases

### 2. Task Decomposition
For the entire design:

#### a) Complete Task List
- **Identify all behaviors** from the design document
- **Create test name** for each behavior
- **Establish logical order** (basic functionality first)
- **Present complete list** to user upfront

#### b) Individual Approval
- **Walk through each task** one by one
- **User says "approved"** to proceed with TDD cycle
- **Execute complete cycle** before moving to next task

### 3. Implementation Cycle

For each task:

#### Step 1: ðŸŸ¢ Green
```
Verify current state:
- Run existing tests: `npm test`
- Confirm all tests pass
- Document current behavior
```

#### Step 2: ðŸ”´ Red
```
Write failing test:
- Define expected behavior in test
- Run test to confirm failure
- Analyze failure message for correctness
```

#### Step 3: ðŸŸ¢ Green
```
Implement minimal solution:
- Write code to make tests pass
- Run full test suite: `npm test`
- Verify no regressions introduced
```

#### Step 4: ðŸŸ¢ Refactor (Interactive)
```
Improve code quality:
- Discuss refactoring opportunities with user
- Apply improvements while maintaining tests
- Verify tests continue to pass after changes
```

## Task Template

```markdown
## Task: [Brief Description]

### Behavior
- [ ] Specific behavior 1
- [ ] Specific behavior 2
- [ ] Edge case handling

### Test Case
- `test("module exports Process class")`

### Test Order
- Position: 3 (after basic creation, before validation)
- Existing functionality Z (must not break)

### Implementation Notes
- Consider security implications
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code patterns
```

## Example Interaction

````
User: Follow `prompts/tdd.md` for `specs/Process/Process.design.md`

Assistant: I'll analyze the Process design and break it down into testable tasks using strict TDD workflow.

Let me first examine the design document to understand the requirements...

[After reading Process.design.md]

## Identified Tasks:

1. `test("module exports Process class")`
2. `test("creates Process with command string")`
3. `test("accepts options object")`
4. `test("throws error for invalid command")`

I'll now walk you through each task for approval. When you say "approved", I'll proceed with the TDD cycle for that task.

**Task 1:** `test("module exports Process class")`
```js
test("module exports Process class", () => {
  const Process = require("./process");
  assert(typeof Process === "function");
});
```
````

## Best Practices

### Task Prioritization
1. **Core Infrastructure**: Base classes and fundamental functionality
2. **Happy Path Features**: Main use cases users will encounter
3. **Edge Cases**: Error handling and boundary conditions
4. **Integration**: How components work together
5. **Performance**: Optimization and efficiency concerns

### Communication Guidelines
- Present one task at a time for approval
- Show clear test cases before implementation
- Explain the TDD phases for each task
- Get explicit approval before moving to next task
- Demonstrate running tests after each phase

### Implementation Standards
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Maintain test coverage above current levels
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior
- Keep implementations minimal until refactor phase
- Run full test suite after each green phase

## Integration with Project Workflow

This prompt works well for:
- **Feature Development**: Breaking down new features into testable chunks
- **Refactoring**: Systematic improvement of existing code
- **Bug Fixes**: Ensuring fixes are properly tested
- **Architecture Changes**: Implementing design changes incrementally
- **Code Reviews**: Demonstrating test-driven approach

## Success Metrics

- All design requirements covered by tasks
- Each task has clear, executable test cases
- TDD workflow followed strictly for each task
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Code quality maintained or improved
- User approval obtained before proceeding
- Tests pass consistently throughout development
