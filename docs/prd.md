- Direct stream access (stdout, stderr, stdin) for advanced users
- Process introspection (command string, configuration)
- Process piping and chaining capabilities
- Complete backward compatibility guarantee

**Success Metrics:**
- All 127 existing tests continue to pass unchanged
- Advanced users can build sophisticated process orchestration
- Zero performance regression from enhancements

### Epic 3: Execa Migration (P2 - Medium)
**Requirement:** Replace manual child_process handling with battle-tested execa library

**Key Features:**
- Migrate from Node.js spawn/spawnSync to execa/execaSync
- Maintain identical API behavior and performance
- Reduce codebase complexity (~100 lines removed)  
- Enhanced error handling and cross-platform reliability
- Process class integration with execa child processes

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero regressions in existing functionality
- Measurable code complexity reduction
- Improved error messages and debugging context

## Technical Requirements

### Security Requirements
- **Shell Injection Prevention:** All template interpolation automatically escaped

### Performance Requirements  
- **Streaming Latency:** <50ms for real-time output processing
- **Memory Efficiency:** Minimal memory overhead for large command outputs
- **CPU Performance:** Negligible overhead compared to raw child_process usage

### Reliability Requirements
- **Error Handling:** Clear, actionable error messages with context
- **Cross-Platform:** Consistent behavior on Unix systems and Windows
