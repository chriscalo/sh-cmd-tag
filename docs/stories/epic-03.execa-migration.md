# Epic 3: Execa Migration

**Status:** Approved  
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)  
**Labels:** migration, execa, performance, reliability  
**Assignee:** Development Team  
**Epic Summary:** Migrate from Node.js child_process to execa for improved reliability, performance, and maintainability while preserving complete API compatibility.

## Epic Description

As maintainers of sh-cmd-tag, we need to replace our manual child_process management with the battle-tested execa library to reduce complexity, improve reliability, and gain access to enhanced process management features while ensuring zero breaking changes for users.

This epic replaces ~100 lines of manual stream handling and process management with execa's proven implementation while maintaining all existing functionality and APIs.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Replace manual spawn/spawnSync with execa/execaSync
- [x] All existing tests pass unchanged (zero regressions)
- [x] Reduced codebase complexity (~100 lines removed)  
- [x] Improved error handling with execa's enhanced context
- [x] Better cross-platform reliability
- [x] Enhanced streaming performance and latency
- [x] Process class integrates seamlessly with execa processes
- [x] Security model preserved completely

## Dependencies

- Epic 1: Core Shell Execution API (complete)
- Epic 2: Process Class Enhancement (complete)
- Execa v9.0.0+ dependency
- Comprehensive regression test validation

## Technical Benefits

**Code Quality:**
- Remove ~100 lines of manual stream handling complexity
- Leverage execa's battle-tested process spawning
- Better error messages and debugging context
- Improved Windows compatibility

**Performance:**  
- Optimized streaming with reduced latency
- More efficient memory usage for large outputs
- Better buffer management for real-time processing

**Reliability:**
- Professional-grade process lifecycle management  
- Enhanced error handling and edge case coverage
- Better resource cleanup and memory management

## Migration Strategy

**Phase 1:** Core execution replacement (executeAsyncCommand/executeSyncCommand)  
**Phase 2:** Streaming integration with Process class  
**Phase 3:** Template literal integration  
**Phase 4:** Testing and validation (all tests must pass)  
**Phase 5:** Performance optimization and cleanup

## Definition of Done

- All existing tests pass without modification
- Process class integrates with execa child processes
- No performance regression (maintain <50ms streaming latency)
- Security tests pass (no new vulnerabilities introduced)  
- Code complexity measurably reduced
- Documentation updated to reflect internal improvements
